## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the Details element, both how to use it and make it possible for only one to be displayed in the accordion at a time, to how to stylize it and even animate it. I also put into practice the CSS "Clamp()" property to be able to have better responsiveness to all devices.

### Continued development

Crear una sombra alrededor de main, usa el elemento header para hacer mas sem√°ntico la web, para reemplazarlo con el div
